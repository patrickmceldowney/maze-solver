# maze-solver

## Mazes

- Each maze must be black and white. White representing a path, and black respresenting a wall.
- one white square exists on the top row, representing the start
- and one white square exists at the bottom row, representing the end

## Running a maze

For help with the script arguments run `py solve.py -h`

`py solve.py -m <method_name> <input_filename>`

`py solve -m dijkstra small`

Running this will output the solved mazes into the directory `solved_mazes`
